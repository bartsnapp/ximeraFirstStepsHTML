<h3 class="sectionHead" id="introduction"><span class="titlemark">2   </span> <a id="x1-20002"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!-- l. 49 --><p class="noindent">Broadly speaking, <strong>integrable probability</strong> is a branch of probability theory which
studies models which have exact solutions. For this reason, these models are often
called <strong>exactly solvable.</strong> From these exact solutions, one can derive precise
<strong>universal</strong> asymptotics, such as the famed Tracy–Widom distribution. The origin of
these solutions are usually due to algebraic symmetries underlying the model. In
these set of lecture notes, we will introduce the relevant algebraic background with a
                                                                  

                                                                  
probabilistic researcher as the target audience.
</p><!-- l. 56 --><p class="noindent">For historical context, the terminology originates in integrable systems from
Hamiltonian mechanics. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the phase space is represented as
a smooth manifold with even dimension \(2n,\) with coordinates denoted 
<span title="q 1 dot dot dot q n comma p 1 dot dot dot p n">\(q_1,\ldots ,q_n,p_1,\ldots ,p_n\)</span> for the
momentumm and position. An integrable system is a system with \(n\) conserved
quantities which are mutually Poisson commuting, and the Liouville–Arnold theorem
states that the equations of motion can be solved in quadratures. For an explicit
example, the harmonic oscillator in one dimension (imagine an object attached to a
frictionless spring) is integrable, and the conserved quantity is the total energy. In
contrast, the three–body problem is not integrable, and its solutions are notoriously
non–exact.
</p><!-- l. 65 --><p class="noindent">During the 1980s, many Soviet mathematicians and physicsts introduced quantum
mechanics into integrable systems. In quantum mechanics, quantities such as position,
momentum and energy became operators which generally do not commute;
additionally, the values of these quantities only take discrete, “quantized” values. In
this context, the concept of “conserved quantities” becomes “commuting operators,”
and values of the quantities are eigenvalues of eigenstates. At the time, their
approaches were called the “quantum inverse scattering method.” Since then, the
method has been generalized to abstract algebraic objects, such as Hopf
algebras.
</p><!-- l. 73 --><p class="noindent">These notes will introduce one such algebraic object, known as <strong>quantum groups,</strong>
with a particular focus on the Yang–Baxter equation. The exposition will use
probability and mathematical physics as a motivation. The goal is for a reader with a
probability background to be able to read contemporary (as of 2024) research papers
in integrable probability.

<!-- l. 82 --><p class="noindent">To begin to motivate the notes, we first introduce the asymmetric simple exclusion
process (ASEP) and its relationship to the Heisenberg XXZ model and the quantum
group \(U_q(sl_2).\)
</p><!-- l. 85 -->
<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="definition-of-asep"><span class="titlemark">3.1   </span> <a id="x1-40003.1"></a>Definition of ASEP</h4>
                                                                  

                                                                  
<!-- l. 86 --><p class="noindent">In ASEP, particles randomly jump on a lattice, which we assume to be one–dimensional.
At most one particle may occupy a site, and jumps to occupied sites are blocked
(hence the term “exclusion”). Jumps are nearest neighbour (hence the term “simple”).
If the jumps are continuous–time exponential clocks with left rates \(\alpha \) and right rates \(\beta ,\)
then let \(q=\sqrt {\beta /\alpha }\) denote the asymmetry parameter. If \(q\neq 1,\) then the model is asymmetric
(sometimes partially asymmetric), while for \(q=1\) the model is symmetric. For \(q=0\) or \(q=\infty \) the
model is called totally asymmetric. The symmetric exclusion process (without
the word simple) can be defined more generally on an arbritrary graph. In
princple, so can the asymmetric exclusion process, although this is not as well
studied.
</p><!-- l. 95 --><p class="noindent"><img alt="PIC" src="../pictures/ASEPScreenshot.png"/>
</p><!-- l. 97 --><p class="noindent">The generator of the simple exclusion process can be explicitly written. In the most
elementary case where there are two lattice sites, then there are four possible
configurations. Associate to each particle the vector \([1\ 0]\) and to each hole (i.e. a
non–particle) the vector \([0 \ 1].\) Tensoring the vectors together, we can associate to each
configuration a canonical basis element of the four–dimensional vector space \(\mathbb {C}\otimes \mathbb {C}.\) The
field here is chosen to be the complex numbers because it is algebraically closed,
although of course probabilities are real numbers.
</p><!-- l. 104 --><p class="noindent"><img alt="PIC" height="8" src="../pictures/ASEPConfigurations.png" width="8"/>
</p><!-- l. 106 --><p class="noindent">With that set up, the generator is then a \(4\times 4\) matrix
                                 \[ \alpha \left ( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; q^2 &amp; -q^2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{array} \right ). \]
 The constant \(\alpha \) can be viewed as a time rescaling, so it can be removed without loss of
generality.
</p><!-- l. 119 --><p class="noindent">In a more general setting, where there are \(N\) lattice sites, the generator can be defined
from the above \(4\times 4\) matrix, which we now denote \(\mathcal {L}.\) The generator is now a \(2^N \otimes 2^N\) and acts on \((\mathbb {C}^2)^{\otimes N}.\)
Define \(\mathcal {L}_{i,i+1}\) by \[ \mathcal {L}_{i,i+1} = (\mathrm {Id}_2)^{i-1} \otimes \mathcal {L} \otimes (\mathrm {Id}_2)^{N-1}. \] With this notation, the generator is \[ \sum _{i=1}^{N-1} \mathcal {L}_{i,i+1}. \] Similar notation using subscripts
will be used throughout these notes.

<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="asep-and-yangbaxter-equation"><span class="titlemark">3.2   </span> <a id="x1-50003.2"></a>ASEP and Yang–Baxter Equation</h4>
<!-- l. 132 --><p class="noindent">The corresponding notion of integrability in the quantum case comes from
Yang–Baxter equation. It was shown by Baxter that when a matrix solves the
Yang–Baxter equation, there are corresponding “commuting transfer matrices,”
which are analogous to conserved quantities in the classical setting.
</p><!-- l. 138 --><p class="noindent">Using the same notation as in the previous section, we say that a matrix \(R\) solves the
<span class="underline">braided Yang–Baxter Equation</span> if: \[ R_{12}R_{23}R_{12} = R_{23}R_{12}R_{23}. \] Somewhat confusingly, this equation is also
sometimes called the braid equation or just the Yang–Baxter equation. An equivalent
formulation is \[ \check {R}_{12}\check {R}_{13}\check {R}_{23} = \check {R}_{23}\check {R}_{13}\check {R}_{12} \] where \(\check {R} = P \circ R\) and \(P(x \otimes y) = y \otimes x\) permutes the tensor power (exercise left to the
reader).
</p><!-- l. 151 --><p class="noindent">A visual representation of YBE is given by this image:
</p><!-- l. 153 --><p class="noindent"><img alt="PIC" height="227" src="../pictures/YBEScreenshot.png" width="227"/>
</p><!-- l. 155 --><p class="noindent">In some settings, the YBE occurs in the scattering of particles with quantum
mechanics considerations, such as the QISM (quantum inverse scattering
method.)
</p><!-- l. 158 --><p class="noindent">Given an arbitrary matrix \(R,\) one can check that it satisfies the YBE through direct
computation. However, it maybe more helpful to consider some simple examples
first.
</p><!-- l. 161 --><p class="noindent">If \(P: V \otimes V \rightarrow V \otimes V\) denotes the permutation operator which sends \(u \otimes v\) to \(v \otimes u,\) then the braided Yang–Baxter
equation becomes an identity of transpositions: \[ (1\ 2) \circ (2 \ 3 ) \circ (1 \ 2 ) = (2 \ 3) \circ (1 \ 2) \circ (2 \ 3). \] This identity holds, since both
sides equal the permutation \((1\ 3).\) An even more simple solution is the identity
matrix.
</p><!-- l. 169 --><p class="noindent">A probabilist may remark that a permutation matrix and an identity matrix are both
examples of a stochastic matrix, albeit somewhat trivial examples. It may then be
natural to try to find more general stochastic matrices which solve the Yang–Baxter
equation. The “simplest” generalization occurs when \(V\) is two–dimensional, with basis \(e_1,e_2.\)
Using exclusion processes as a prototype, we can define the operator \(R_{\alpha \beta }\) by \[ R_{\alpha \beta }(e_1 \otimes e_1) = e_1 \otimes e_1, \quad R_{\alpha \beta }(e_2\otimes e_2) = e_2 \otimes e_2 \] and
\begin{align*} R_{\alpha \beta }(e_1 \otimes e_2) &amp;= (1-\alpha )e_1 \otimes e_2 + \alpha e_2 \otimes e_1,\\ R_{\alpha \beta }(e_2 \otimes e_1) &amp;= \beta e_1\otimes e_2 + (1-\beta )e_2 \otimes e_1. \end{align*}
</p><!-- l. 182 --><p class="noindent">Inserting this matrix into the Yang–Baxter equation and evaluating at \(e_1 \otimes e_1 \otimes e_2,\) one finds that
\(\alpha (1-\beta )=0\) is a necessary requirement for a solution to YBE. Evaluating \( R_{\alpha ,1}\) and \(R_{0,\beta }\) at \(e_1\otimes e_2 \otimes e_1\) and \(e_2 \otimes e_1 \otimes e_1\) yields no
aditional equations. (Exercise left to the reader)
</p><!-- l. 187 --><p class="noindent">One could also evaluate YBE at the three vectors \(e_2 \otimes e_1 \otimes e_1,e_1\otimes e_2 \otimes e_1\) and \(e_1 \otimes e_1 \otimes e_2,\) but instead we use another
symmetry of ASEP. This is called <span class="underline">particle–hole involution.</span> In words, in an ASEP
with drift to the right, the holes evolve as an ASEP with drift to the left.
Symbolically, we define an involution \(T\) of \(V\) which switches \(e_1\) and \(e_2.\) Then \[ T^{\otimes 2} R_{\alpha ,\beta }T^{\otimes 2} = R_{\beta ,\alpha }, \quad \quad T^{\otimes 2} R_{\alpha ,\beta } = R_{1-\alpha ,1-\beta }, \quad \quad R_{\alpha ,\beta }T^{\otimes 2} = R_{1-\beta ,1-\alpha }. \] A mildly
helpful observation here is that \(T\) is stochastic, so its composition with other stochastic
matrices is also stochastic. Using these identities, one immediately verifies YBE for \(R_{\alpha ,0}\)
and \(R_{1,\beta }.\) Furthermore, these two solutions are related up to the particle–hole
involution.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 199 --><p class="noindent">One notices that \(P\circ R_{\alpha ,0}-\mathrm {id}_4\) is the generator of ASEP at two lattice sites. It is then natural to
ask whether or not addition by constants affects integrability. The answer is “no”
(otherwise integrable probability would not exist). As some intuition, let us suppose
that the generator has an explicit set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. In general, an
arbitrary Markov process will have complicated eigenvectors and eigenvalues, but for
integrable models we expect “nice” eigenvectors and eigenvalues, from which
probabilistic information can be extracted. Then addition by constants leaves the
eigenvectors unaffects and only shifts the eigenvalues, leaving them just as
“nice.” Thus, it is fair to say that ASEP is integrable, at least on two lattice
sites.
</p><!-- l. 208 --><p class="noindent">At this juncture, it is reasonable to object that nothing has been said about the
integrability of ASEP on arbitrarily many lattice sites. We will put this question on
hold, as the next section’s discussion of the XXZ model will lay the foundation for
answering this question.
</p><!-- l. 212 -->
<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="xxz-model"><span class="titlemark">3.3   </span> <a id="x1-60003.3"></a>XXZ model</h4>
<!-- l. 213 --><p class="noindent">Having established that ASEP is an integrable model at two lattice sites, it is natural
to ask about other integrable models that look similar to ASEP, so that we can avoid
re–inventing the wheel. Thus we now turn our attention to a related model, called the
quantum Heisenberg model. These were introduced by Werner Heisenberg to
incorporate quantum mechanics into magnetism. Each lattice site has a microscopic
magnetic dipole, which can either be up or down. If there are \(N\) lattice sites,
then the Hamiltonian acts on the \(2^N\)–dimensional vector space \((\mathbb {C}^2)^{\otimes N}.\) So, at the
very least, the state space of the XXZ model is the same as the ASEP state
space.
</p><!-- l. 221 --><p class="noindent">To define the model, first recall that Pauli spin matrices: \[ \sigma ^1 = \left (\begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{array}\right ), \quad \quad \sigma ^2 = \left ( \begin{array}{cc} 0 &amp; -i \\ i &amp; 0 \end{array}\right ), \quad \quad \sigma ^3 = \left ( \begin{array}{cc} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 \end{array}\right ). \] The notation \(\sigma ^x,\sigma ^y,\sigma ^z\) are
often used instead. Note that these are traceless and are Hermitian, the
latter property being important in physics (since Hermitian matrices have
real eigenvalues, and these eigenvalues correspond to physical quantities).
Letting \[ \sigma ^a_j = (\mathrm {Id})^{\otimes j-1} \otimes \sigma ^a \otimes (\mathrm {Id})^{\otimes N-j} \] so that \(\sigma ^a_j\) acts on the \(j\)–th lattice site while fixing the others, the
Hamiltonian is then \[ \frac {-1}{2}\sum _{j=1}^N \left ( J_x \sigma ^1_j \sigma ^1_{j+1} + J_y \sigma ^2_j \sigma ^2_{j+1} + J_z \sigma ^3_j\sigma ^3_{j+1} - h\sigma ^3_j\right ). \] where \(J_x,J_y,J_z\) are some coupling constants and \(h\) is the external field.
We impose periodic boundary conditions, so that \(\sigma ^a_{N+1}=\sigma ^a_1.\) If \(J_x,J_y,J_z\) are distinct then one
obtains the XYZ model. If \(J_x=J_y \neq J_z\) then this is the XXZ model; if \(J_x=J_y=J_z\) then it is the XXX
model.
</p><!-- l. 240 --><p class="noindent">Each summand in the Hamiltonian can be written as a four by four matrix: \[ \left (\begin{array}{cccc} J_z + 2h &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; J_x-J_y \\ 0 &amp; -J_z &amp; J_x + J_y &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; J_x + J_y &amp; -J_z &amp; 0 \\ J_x - J_y &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; J_z-2h \end{array}\right ) \] If \(J_x=J_y,\)
as assumed in the XXZ model, then the top–right and bottom–left entries
are zero. In this case, the non–zero entries are at least the same as in the
ASEP generator. Recalling the previous section’s heuristic that adding by
constants does not change integrability, we can set \(J_z=1,h=0\) to obtain the matrix
                                                                  

                                                                  
\[ \mathrm {Id}_4 + \left ( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -2 &amp; 2J_x &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 2J_x &amp; -2 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{array}\right ). \]
</p><!-- l. 262 --><p class="noindent">At this point, it is worth noticing that the YBE is a statement about operators on
vector spaces, which should not depend on the choice of bases on the vector spaces.
In other words, conjugation (which corresponds to a change of basis) should not
affect integrability. As it turns out, conjugation by \[ \left ( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \gamma -1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{array} \right ) \] results in the ASEP generator on
two sites. (Exercise left to the reader).

<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="sl-symmetry"><span class="titlemark">3.4   </span> <a id="x1-70003.4"></a>\(sl_2\) symmetry</h4>
<!-- l. 278 --><p class="noindent">Next, we introduce the \(sl_2\) symmetry of ASEP. This was first observed in the seminal
paper of <span class="cite">[<a href="#XSch97">1</a>]</span>.
</p><!-- l. 280 --><p class="noindent">So far, we have determined that ASEP is integrable and is conjugate to the XXZ
Hamiltonian (assuming that we are ignoring the question of arbitrary lattice
sizes). As it turns out, the Pauli matrices form a basis of the real Lie algebra \(su_2\)
corresponding to the real compact Lie group \(SU(2).\) Here, a real Lie group means
that the underlying field is the real numbers, not that all the entries are
real (consider the unit circle in the complex plane as a real Lie group, for
example).
</p><!-- l. 286 --><p class="noindent">The complex variant of \(SU(2)\) is the (non–compact) Lie group \(SL(2,\mathbb {C})\) of traceless \(2 \times 2\) matrices with
complex entries. For a variety of reasons, some of which answer historical, most
mathematicians are introduce to the Lie algebra \(sl_2\) rather than \(su_2,\) so we will use that
notation.
</p><!-- l. 290 --><p class="noindent">By definition, \(sl_2\) is the Lie algebra with basis denoted \(e,f,h\) and brackets \[ [e,f]=h, \quad [h,e]=2e, \quad [h,f]=-2f. \] Note that the
explicit matrices \(E_{12},E_{21},E_{11}-E_{22}\) satisfy these relations, where \(E_{ij}\) denotes the matrix with a \(1\) at the
\(i,j\)–entry and a 0 everywhere else.
</p><!-- l. 297 --><p class="noindent">Returning to the XYZ model, one can calculate that the XXX model has \(SU(2)\) symmetry
(exercise to the reader) in the sense that \[ \sum _{j=1}^N \sigma ^a_j \] commutes with the Hamiltonian of the
XXX model for \(a=x,y,z.\) However, for the XXZ model, the commutation only works for \(a=z.\)
Therefore, whatever algebra is underlying the XXZ model (and hence that of ASEP),
we know that it can not be as simple as \(SU(2).\) Futhermore, since XXZ and ASEP have a
free parameter, the algebra should be a one–parameter deformation of \(SU(2).\) This leads
into the next topic of quantum groups.

<!-- l. 309 --><p class="noindent">The Drinfel’d–Jimbo quantum groups are quantizations of the Lie groups. Rather
confusingly, the quantum groups are not themselves groups.
</p><!-- l. 312 --><p class="noindent">Before diving into the rigorous definition, one notes where the quantization
occurs. Using probabilistic intuition, we expect that the SSEP should have an
underlying \(sl_2\) symmetry, whereas the ASEP should have the quantum group
symmetry. However, SSEP and ASEP on a single lattice site are identical, so the
quantization must require multiple lattice sites. We’ve established that in this
case, the vector space is \((\mathbb {C}^{\otimes 2})^{\otimes N}.\) This raises the question: how does \(sl_2\) act on tensor
powers?
</p><!-- l. 319 --><p class="noindent">To answer this question, we take an aside about Lie algebras, which are tangent
spaces to Lie groups at the origin. What this implies is that for a Lie group \(G\) with a
Lie algebra \(g,\) we have that \[ X \in g \text { implies } \exp (tX) \in G \text { for all } t\in \mathbb {R} \] and \[ X = \frac {d}{dt} \exp (tX) \Big |_{t=0}. \] Setting \(g=g_X(t)=\exp (tX),\) the natural action of a group on tensor
products is \[ g(v \otimes w)= gv \otimes gw. \] Taking derivatives and heuristically using Leibniz’s rule for derivative of
products, we obtain \[ X(v \otimes w) = Xv \otimes w + v \otimes Xw. \] This is expressed through the <span class="underline">co–product</span> \(\Delta : g \rightarrow g \otimes g\) defined by
\[ \Delta (X) = 1 \otimes X + X \otimes 1. \]
</p><!-- l. 341 --><p class="noindent">Since it is the co–product that allows for the algebra to act on multiple lattice sites
(i.e. tensor powers), the quantization occurs in the co–product, not the algebra itself!
As it turns out, the right deformation is \[ \Delta (e) = q^h \otimes e + e \otimes 1, \quad \Delta (f) = 1 \otimes f + f \otimes q^{-h}, \quad \Delta (h)=h\otimes 1 + 1\otimes h, \] where we interpret \(q^h\) as a formal power series
in \(h.\) Note that we do not deform the co–product of \(h,\) which is consistent with \(\sigma ^z\)
commuting with the XXZ model.
</p><!-- l. 349 --><p class="noindent">Depending on the preferences of the author, the generator \(h\) may be replaced with \(k:=q^h\)
with the co–product becoming \[ \Delta (k) = k \otimes k. \] (Exercise to the reader why that is the same
co–product). In words, \(h\) is primitive and \(k\) is group–like.

<!-- l. 358 --><p class="noindent">While I presented the co–product as the object that allows for multiple lattice sites,
that is of course not how it is presented to algebraists. A more common
description is that a co–algebra is dual to an algebra, with the co–product
dual to the product. This subsection will provide a rigorous definition of a
co–algebras.
</p><!-- l. 363 --><p class="noindent">One motivation is that the space of functions on an algebra is a co–algebra. The Lie
algebra is actually itself a space of differential operators on a Lie group (it is the
direction derivative), so is a space of functions on the algebra of smooth functions on
the Lie group. Thus, you would expect a Lie algebra to have a co–algebra
structure.
</p><!-- l. 369 --><p class="noindent">Recall that an algebra \(A\) is a vector space with a multiplication operator \[ m: A \otimes A \rightarrow A \] which
assumed to be bilinear. It is also associative in the sense that \[ m(x \otimes m(y \otimes z)) = m(m(x \otimes y) \otimes z), \] which essentially
means that \( x(yz) = (xy)z.\) This is equivalently stated as \[ m \circ (m \otimes \mathrm {id}) = m \circ (\mathrm {id} \otimes m). \] Additionally, there is an identity element \(1 \in A\)
                                                                  

                                                                  
satisfying \[ m(1 \otimes x) = m(x \otimes 1) = x. \] This can be written as an inclusion from the underlying field \(F\) to the
algebra \(A.\)

we now introduce a spectral–dependent Yang–Baxter Equation that comes from
affine Lie algebras.
</p><!-- l. 489 --><p class="noindent">Given a finite–dimensional Lie algebra \(\mathfrak {g}\), define its affinization by
                                 \[ \hat {\mathfrak {g}} = \mathfrak {g} \otimes _{\mathbb {C}} \oplus \mathbb {C}[t,t^{-1}] \oplus \mathbb {C}c \]
 where \(c\) is a central element. In words, this is a one–dimensional central extension of
the loop algebra over \(\mathfrak {g}.\) The Lie bracket is then defined by
                                 \[ [a\otimes t^n, b\otimes t^m] = [a,b] \otimes t^{n+m} + (a,b)n\delta _{m,-n}c \]
 where \((\cdot ,\cdot )\) is the Cartan–Killing form on \(\mathfrak {g}.\) This Lie algebra is now infinite–dimensional,
which makes its representation theory tricker.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 501 --><p class="noindent">There is an analogous quantum group \(\mathcal {U}_q(\mathfrak {g}),\) which has an \(R\)–matrix satisfying Yang–Baxter
equation. For modules where \(c\) acts as \(0\) (level \(0\) representations), we can define an
evaluation module by takng a module of \(\mathfrak {g}\) and then letting \(t\) act as multiplication
by \(z\). If the element \(R\) now acts on evaluation modules, then it depends on a
parameter which we call the spectral parameter. The Yang–Baxter equation now
reads
                                 \[ \check {R}_{12}(z) \check {R}_{13}(zw) \check {R}_{23}(w) = \check {R}_{23}(w) \check {R}_{13}(zw) \check {R}_{12}(z). \]
 If we attempt to find \(4\times 4\) solutions to the spectral–dependent YBE analogous to ASEP,
we get a two–parameter family of solutions, which end up being the weights of the
stochastic six vertex model.

preserved by any \(P_{i,i+1}.\) For quantum groups, however, we have a \(q\)–deformation in the

</p><!-- l. 523 --><p class="noindent">In lieu of an extensive algebraic discussion, we present it in probabilistic language.
Recall Pitman–Rogers intertwining: suppose there are two Markov kernels \(\Lambda \) and \(\Phi \)

</p><!-- l. 534 --><p class="noindent">This procedure is sometimes called fusion.

 If for all \(v\), we have that \(v\Lambda \) is stationary under \(P\), i.e. \(v\Lambda P = v\Lambda \), then the above intertwining
becomes
                                 \[ v\Lambda = v\Lambda \Phi \Lambda \]
 which then follows from \(\Lambda \Phi =\mathrm {Id}.\)

<!-- l. 554 --><p class="noindent">From here, let \(k=q^h.\)
</p><!-- l. 556 --><p class="noindent">We define some subalgebras by letting \(U^{&gt; 0}\) be generated by \(e,\) and \(U^{&lt;0}\) generated by \(f\)
and \(U^0\) generated by \(k\). Analogously, \(U^{\geq 0}\) is generated by \(e,k\) and \(U^{\leq 0}\) is generated by \(f,k\).
There are central elements, sometimes called Casimir elements, that have the
form
                                 \[ C \in U^0 + U^{&lt; 0}U^{&gt; 0}. \]
</p><!-- l. 563 --><p class="noindent">One reason for introducing these subalgebras is because of the highest weight
representations. We call \(V\) a highest weight representation if there exists a vector \(v,\)
called the highest weight vector, such that
                                 \[ U^{&gt;0}v=0 \]
 and \(V\) is generated by \(U^{\leq 0}v.\) Then the action of the Casimir on the highest weight vector is
given by
                                                                  

                                                                  
                                 \[ Cv = av \]
 for some complex number \(a.\) Also let \(\{v_{\mu }:\mu \in \mathcal {B}\}\) denote a basis of \(V,\) where each \(v_{\mu }\) can be expressed
as \(F^{\mu }v\) for some \(F^{\mu } \in U^{\leq 0}.\)
</p><!-- l. 575 --><p class="noindent">We define the Hamiltonian \(H\) by taking the co–product of \(C\) on tensor powers of
representations:

 We want to find a diagonal matrix \(G\) such that \(G^{-1}HG-c\mathrm {Id}\) is the generator of a continuous–time
Markov process. As a necessary condition, we need that \(G^{-1}HG\) has rows which sum to \(c\);
non–negativity is more difficult to ensure. One way to achieve this is with an
eigenvector of eigenvalue \(c\). Namely, assume that \(g\) is a vector such that \(Hg=cg.\) If \(g\) has the
form
                                 \[ g=\sum _{\boldsymbol {\mu }=(\mu _1,\mu _2)\in \mathcal {B}\times \mathcal {B}} g(\boldsymbol {\mu }) v_{\mu _1}\otimes v_{\mu _2} \]
 then the diagonal matrix \(G(\boldsymbol {\mu },\boldsymbol {\mu })=g(\boldsymbol {\mu })\) will satisfy the necessary requirement, as long as \(g(\boldsymbol {\mu })\) is always
nonzero.
                                                                  

                                                                  
</p><!-- l. 589 --><p class="noindent">As it turns out, \(g=v\otimes v\) (the tensor power of the highest weight vector) will satsify
                                 \[ Hg=a^2g \]
 due to the form of the co–product and the central element. However, this choice will
have zero entries. So instead we take \(g\) of the form
                                 \[ \sum _{\boldsymbol {\mu }=(\mu _1,\mu _2)} c(\mu _1,\mu _2)\Delta (F^{\mu _1}F^{\mu _2}) v\otimes v \]
 for some appropriate choice of coefficients \(c(\mu _1,\mu _2)\) (reference the appendix for more detailed
calculations).
