Accessibility statement: \href{https://ximera.osu.edu/firststeps24html/aFirstStepInXimera/basics/FRT_Construction_WCAG}{A WCAG2.1AA compliant version of these notes} will eventually available, once I finish writing them. I tested it out using NVDA, a screen reader.
It works best if you uncheck ``graphic'' and ``clickable'' in the settings. I am also testing out dyslexia--friendly 
fonts right now. 
You can also \href{https://ximera.osu.edu/firststeps24html/aFirstStepInXimera/basics/FRT_Construction.tex}{download the TeX source file.}
