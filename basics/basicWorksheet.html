<!-- l. 22 --><p class="noindent">Broadly speaking, <strong>integrable probability</strong> is a branch of probability theory which
studies models which have exact solutions. For this reason, these models are often
called <strong>exactly solvable.</strong> From these exact solutions, one can derive precise
<strong>universal</strong> asymptotics, such as the famed Tracy–Widom distribution. The origin of
these solutions are usually due to algebraic symmetries underlying the model. In
these set of lecture notes, we will introduce the relevant algebraic background with a
probabilistic researcher as the target audience.
</p><!-- l. 29 --><p class="noindent">For historical context, the terminology originates in integrable systems from
Hamiltonian mechanics. In Hamiltonian mechanics, the phase space is represented as
a smooth manifold with even dimension \(2n,\) with coordinates denoted \(q_1,\ldots ,q_n,p_1,\ldots ,p_n\) for the
momentumm and position. An integrable system is a system with \(n\) conserved
quantities, and the Liouville–Arnold theorem states that the equations of
motion can be solved in quadratures. For an explicit example, the harmonic
oscillator in one dimension (imagine an object attached to a frictionless spring)
is integrable, and the conserved quantity is the total energy. In contrast,
the three–body problem is not integrable, and its solutions are notoriously
non–exact.
</p><!-- l. 38 --><p class="noindent">During the 1980s, many Soviet mathematicians and physicsts introduced quantum
mechanics into integrable systems. In quantum mechanics, quantities such as position,
momentum and energy became operators which generally do not commute;
additionally, the values of these quantities only take discrete, “quantized” values. In
this context, the concept of “conserved quantities” becomes “commuting operators,”
and values of the quantities are eigenvalues of eigenstates. At the time, their
approaches were called the “quantum inverse scattering method.” Since then, the
method has been generalized to abstract algebraic objects, such as Hopf
algebras.
</p><!-- l. 46 --><p class="noindent">These notes will introduce one such algebraic object, known as <strong>quantum groups,</strong>
with a particular focus on the Yang–Baxter equation. The exposition will use
probability and mathematical physics as a motivation. The goal is for a reader with a
probability background to be able to read contemporary (as of 2024) research papers
in integrable probability.

<!-- l. 55 --><p class="noindent">To begin to motivate the notes, we first introduce the asymmetric simple exclusion
process (ASEP) and its relationship to the Heisenberg XXZ model and the quantum
group \(U_q(sl_2).\)
</p><!-- l. 58 -->
<h4 class="subsectionHead" id="asep"><span class="titlemark">2.1   </span> <a id="x1-30002.1"></a>ASEP</h4>
<!-- l. 59 --><p class="noindent">In ASEP, particles randomly jump on a lattice, which we assume to be one–dimensional.
At most one particle may occupy a site, and jumps to occupied sites are blocked
(hence the term “exclusion”). Jumps are nearest neighbour (hence the term “simple”).
If the jumps are continuous–time exponential clocks with left rates \(\alpha \) and right rates \(\beta ,\)
then let \(q=\sqrt {\beta /\alpha $} denote the asymmetry parameter. If \)q≠1,\( then the model is asymmetric (sometimes partially asymmetric), while for \)q=1\( the model is symmetric. For \)q=0\( or \)q=\(\infty \) the model is called totally asymmetric. The symmetric
exclusion process (without the word simple) can be defined more generally on an
arbritrary graph. In princple, so can the asymmetric exclusion process, although this
is not as well studied.
</p><!-- l. 68 --><p class="noindent"><img alt="PIC" src="../pictures/ASEPScreenshot.png"/>
</p><!-- l. 70 --><p class="noindent">The generator of the simple exclusion process can be explicitly written. In the most
elementary case where there are two lattice sites, then there are four possible
configurations. Associate to each particle the vector \([1\ 0]\) and to each hole (i.e. a
non–particle) the vector \([0 \ 1].\) Tensoring the vectors together, we can associate to each
configuration a canonical basis element of the four–dimensional vector space \(\mathbb {C}\otimes \mathbb {C}.\) The
field here is chosen to be the complex numbers because it is algebraically closed,
although of course probabilities are real numbers.
</p><!-- l. 77 --><p class="noindent"><img alt="PIC" src="../pictures/ASEPConfigurations.png"/>
</p><!-- l. 79 --><p class="noindent">With that set up, the generator is then a \(4\times 4\) matrix
                                                                  

                                                                  
                                 \[ \alpha \left ( \begin{array}{cccc} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; q^2 &amp; -q^2 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{array} \right ). \]
 The constant \(\alpha \) can be viewed as a time rescaling, so it can be removed without loss of
generality.
</p><!-- l. 92 --><p class="noindent">In a more general setting, where there are \(N\) lattice sites, the generator can be defined
from the above \(4\times 4\) matrix, which we now denote \(\mathcal {L}.\) The generator is now a \(2^N \otimes 2^N\) and acts on \((\mathbb {C}^2)^{\otimes N}.\)
Define \(\mathcal {L}_{i,i+1}\) by \[ \mathcal {L}_{i,i+1} = (\mathrm {Id}_2)^{i-1} \otimes \mathcal {L} \otimes (\mathrm {Id}_2)^{N-1}. \] With this notation, the generator is \[ \sum _{i=1}^{N-1} \mathcal {L}_{i,i+1}. \] Similar notation using subscripts
will be used throughout these notes.
</p><!-- l. 104 -->
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead" id="yangbaxter-equation"><a id="x1-4000"></a>Yang–Baxter Equation</h5>
<!-- l. 106 --><p class="noindent">Using the same notation, we say that a matrix \(R\) solves the <span class="underline">braided Yang–Baxter
Equation</span> if: \[ R_{12}R_{23}R_{12} = R_{23}R_{12}R_{23}. \] Somewhat confusingly, this equation is also sometimes called the braid
equation or just the Yang–Baxter equation. An equivalent formulation is \[ R_{12}R_{13}R_{23} = R_{23}R_{13}R_{12} \] (exercise
left to the reader). Given an arbitrary matrix \(R,\) one can check that it satisfies the YBE
through direct computation. However, it maybe more helpful to consider some simple
examples first.
</p><!-- l. 118 --><p class="noindent">If \(P: V \otimes V \rightarrow V \otimes V\) denotes the permutation operator which sends \(u \otimes v\) to \(v \otimes u,\) then the braided Yang–Baxter
equation becomes an identity of transpositions: \[ (1\ 2) \circ (2 \ 3 ) \circ (1 \2 ) = (2 \ 3) \circ (1 \ 2) \circ (2 \ 3). \] This identity holds, since both
sides equal the permutation \((1\ 3).\) An even more simple solution is the identity
matrix.
</p><!-- l. 126 --><p class="noindent">A probabilist may remark that a permutation matrix and an identity matrix are both
examples of a stochastic matrix, albeit somewhat trivial examples. It may then be
natural to try to find more general stochastic matrices which solve the Yang–Baxter
equation. The “simplest” generalization occurs when \(V\) is two–dimensional, with basis \(e_1,e_2.\)
Using exclusion processes as a prototype, we can define the operator \(R_{\alpha \beta }\) by \[ R_{\alpha \beta }(e_1 \otimes e_1) = e_1 \otimes e_1, \quad R_{\alpha \beta }(e_2\otimes e_2) = e_2 \otimes e_2 \] and
\begin{align*} R_{\alpha \beta }(e_1 \otimes e_2) &amp;= (1-\alpha )e_1 \otimes e_2 + \alpha e_2 \otimes e_1,\\ R_{\alpha \beta }(e_2 \otimes e_1) &amp;= \beta e_1\otimes e_2 + (1-\beta )e_2 \otimes e_1. \end{align*}
</p><!-- l. 139 --><p class="noindent">Inserting this matrix into the Yang–Baxter equation and evaluating at \(e_1 \otimes e_1 \otimes e_2,\) one finds that
\(\alpha (1-\beta )=0\) is a necessary requirement for a solution to YBE. Evaluating \( R_{\alpha ,1}\) and \(R_{0,\beta }\) at \(e_1\otimes e_2 \otimes e_1\) and \(e_2 \otimes e_1 \otimes e_1\) yields no
aditional equations. (Exercise left to the reader)
</p><!-- l. 144 --><p class="noindent">One could also evaluate YBE at the three vectors \(e_2 \otimes e_1 \otimes e_1,e_1\otimes e_2 \otimes e_1\) and \(e_1 \otimes e_1 \otimes e_2,\) but instead we use another
symmetry of ASEP. This is called <span class="underline">particle–hole involution.</span> In words, in an ASEP
with drift to the right, the holes evolve as an ASEP with drift to the left.
Symbolically, we define an involution \(T\) of \(V\) which switches \(e_1\) and \(e_2.\) Then \[ T^{\otimes 2} R_{\alpha ,\beta }T^{\otimes 2} = R_{\beta ,\alpha }, \quad \quad T^{\otimes 2} R_{\alpha ,\beta } = R_{1-\alpha ,1-\beta }, \quad \quad R_{\alpha ,\beta }T^{\otimes 2} = R_{1-\beta ,1-\alpha }. \] A mildly
helpful observation here is that \(T\) is stochastic, so its composition with other stochastic
matrices is also stochastic. Using these identities, one immediately verifies YBE for \(R_{\alpha ,0}\)
and \(R_{1,\beta }.\) Furthermore, these two solutions are related up to the particle–hole
involution.

<!-- l. 159 --><p class="noindent">We now turn our attention to a related model, called the quantum Heisenberg model.
These were introduced by Werner Heisenberg to incorporate quantum mechanics into
magnetism. Each lattice site has a microscopic magnetic dipole, which can either be
up or down. If there are \(N\) lattice sites, then the Hamiltonian acts on the \(2^N\)–dimensional
vector space \(\mathbb {C}^2)^{\otimes N}.\)
